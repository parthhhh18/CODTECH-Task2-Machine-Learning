# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## Internship
CODTECH Data Analysis Internship – Task 2 (Machine Learning)

## Objective
To build and evaluate machine learning models that predict house prices
based on various housing features.

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle – House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques
- Records: 1460
- Features: 81

## Models Implemented
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor

## Evaluation Metrics
- R² Score
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

## Results
| Model | R² Score | RMSE |
|------|----------|------|
| Linear Regression | 0.756 | 0.213 |
| Random Forest | 0.883 | 0.147 |

## Conclusion
Random Forest Regressor outperformed Linear Regression by capturing
non-linear relationships in the data, resulting in higher accuracy
and lower prediction error.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open the notebook in Jupyter
4. Run all cells sequentially
